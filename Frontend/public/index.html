    <noscript>Studying far away from home can be hectic, especially if the hostel allotment takes time - uncertainty looms over forcing a student to look for alternate arrangements, even more so in these trying times of the pandemic. Keeping these problems in mind, develop a hostel management system that should include ,but not limited to,features for allocation of room, reallocation of room, no of rooms empty, no of students from a particular institute in a particular hostel building, faster payment, access to student info,guest room available.</noscript>
